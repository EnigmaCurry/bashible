#### - COMMAND [ARG1] [ARG2] ...

Represents a task. The task may be a command or a bash function. (Actually, the '-' itself is a bash function and everything that follows are arguments.)

When the command exits nonzero, further execution of the script (and all caller scripts) is halted and an error is displayed.

You can prefix it with [may_fail](may_fail.md) to avoid stopping execution, if the exitcode does not matter.

Use [when](when.md) to skip all following tasks in the same block.

##### Example:

```bash
@ Installing nginx
  - when not test -f /usr/bin/nginx   # set skipping mode if the test succeeds
  - yum_install nginx                 # skipped if already
  - systemctl start nginx             # skipped if already

@ Purging temporary files if any      # now the skipping mode is off again
  - may_fail rm /tmp/temp1
  - may_fail rm /tmp/temp2
```
